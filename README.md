## Description
In this express.js app I made shop backend logic where users can register/login and add/update/remove products from a cart.

## How to start

### `git clone https://github.com/TsugaruBurst/shop-backend.git`
### `cd shop-backend`
### `npm install`
Edit .env file
### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Now you can make requests in Postman/Insomnia and other apps like these.
